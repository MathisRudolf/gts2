# GTS2
This game is designed as a PostgreSQL playgound and techdemo.
By utilizing PostGIS and Openstreetmap, the Database allows for quick geospatial queries for either buisness logic or rendering.

The games logic is based on triggers and constraints. Hence here's little the Application has to do besides rendering and forwarding commands like "accelerate".



Currently based on Python2.7 the key requirements on the frontend are:

 * pygame
 * psycopg2

The Server requirements are:

 * postgresql >= 9.5
 * EXTENSION: postgis 2.2
 * EXTENSION: unaccent


## Current State
The games development has recently been rushed and alot of items need to be reworked.
